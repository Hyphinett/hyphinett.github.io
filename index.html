    <div class="Bio">
        <h2>welcome to hyphin.net!</h2> 
        I'm a game developer, musician and artist.<br>
        Notable game titles I've worked on are If Found, Dread X Collection 3(Bubbo: Adventure On Geralds Island), and The Haunted PS1 Demo Discs (2020/21).<br>
        In addition to helping organise the Haunted PS1 Demo Discs in 2021 and 2020 I am also the founder of the Haunted PS1, having started the discord server in 2018.<br>
        I love making electronic music, I've been making Ambient Drum and Bass and Jungle inspired tracks for about a year now, and my first release is soon approaching.<br>
